# **Improving Your Technical Writing: Tips and Tricks for Software Developers and Why This Matters**

Author(s): **Terry Gichuhi, Roy Waswa and Abol Ger**

We all experience those incredible \"Aha!\" moments when everythingcfalls into place. Whether it\'s fixing a persistent bug or discovering a better approach to a problem, these bursts of enlightenment are like treasures we want to share with others. However, sharing knowledge isn\'t always easy. While <u> [YouTubers like Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/#section-1672491685391)</u> make it look effortless, creating high-quality videos while breaking down complex topics on software development is not only difficult and expensive, documentation still remains one of the most effective ways to communicate ideas and concepts to others within and without the tech community.

## **Why Technical Writing Skills Matter**

As a developer, the ability to articulate your ideas, share knowledge effectively, and foster collaboration through well-crafted technical documentation is invaluable. It enables you to seamlessly onboard new team members, bridge gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and empower users to utilize your software solution effectively. 

Reflecting on our own journeys, we cannot stress enough the significance of technical writing skills in a developer\'s career. By mastering the art of technical writing, you unlock a powerful tool that amplifies your impact, opens doors to leadership positions, and ultimately paves the way for success in the dynamic world of software development.

One major benefit of developing your technical writing skills is the ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly to different audiences, whether they are developers, project managers, or clients. This clear communication eliminates confusion, reduces errors, and ensures everyone is on the same page. Further, with a focus on syntax, error handling, and proper formatting, we have become more meticulous in our approach to documentation during development (and not waiting till the end) so that comments in the code also communicate better to others.

## **What is the end-game?**

#### **Having clear aims for your article serves as a compass to keep you on track. Whether you want to provide information, guide readers, or explain complex concepts, outlining your aims helps you filter your thoughts and focus on what\'s relevant. It ensures a cohesive and purposeful piece.**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  >For example, in this post, we're aiming to provide you with practical tips and guidance to help you, developers, improve your technical writing skills such as identifying the audience, creating a detailed brief, and structuring your content while maintaining clarity and simplicity, providing suggestions on how to bridge theory and practice, and finally, choosing the right platform to share your regularly updated articles.

## **Who am I targeting?**

Before you start writing, it\'s crucial to identify your target audience. Whether it\'s fellow developers, junior developers seeking guidance, or non-technical stakeholders, understanding your audience allows you to tailor your writing to their needs. Consider their preferences, what resonates with them, and relatable analogies. By envisioning a specific person who would appreciate your information the most, you can create a connection and give your writing a personal touch.

## **What is the message?**

Create a detailed brief that outlines your main talking points and strengthens your content. Address common questions, share innovative ideas or solutions, and explain the methods you employed to reach those solutions. Your brief acts as a guide, helping you maintain coherence and flow throughout the writing process. It also allows you to work on your piece in parts.

The content of your piece should also flow the audience you\'re targeting and their level of experience. When addressing those with limited experience, break down complex concepts into simple principles. When writing for peers, feel free to utilize technical jargon. Striking the right balance between accessibility and technical depth ensures your content resonates with and adds value to your readers.

Below are additional tips that you can incorporate when writing your
article.

1.  Clarity and Simplicity: In technical writing, clarity is paramount.
    > Avoid convoluted sentences and ambiguous language. Be concise and get straight to the point. Use clear explanations, examples, code snippets and visuals when necessary to enhance understanding.

2.  Structured Approach: Organize your article with a logical flow. Use
    > headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break down complex topics into digestible chunks. This makes it easier for readers to follow your ideas and locate specific information.

3.  Bridging Theory and Practice: As developers, we often deal with
    > abstract concepts that can be challenging to grasp. Whenever possible, provide real-world examples and practical applications to help readers connect theory with practice.

Once your piece is ready, it\'s time to consider where to publish it.
Choose a platform that aligns with the tech community\'s interests and
preferences. Even on a more generic platform like Medium, Github or
Stack Overflow, targeting a specific tech-oriented community can greatly
increase the appreciation and engagement with your piece.

The simple answer therefore is it depends. Here's a brief summary, based
on the authors' collective experience, of the pros and cons of each
platform that will guide you on selecting the appropriate platform:



| **Platform**| **Pros**| **Cons** |
|-------------|---------|----------|
|[Medium](https://medium.com/)|1. Wide audience and visibility </br> 2. Easy to publish and share | Less focused on technical content|
|[Github](https://github.com/topics)|1. Developer-centric</br> 2. Widely used for code sharing| Limited visibility outside the developer community|
|[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)|1. Accessible community of experts</br> 2.  Focused on Q&A and problem-solving| May require more experience to contribute meaningful content|


These are not the only platforms; tools (like
<u>[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions))</u>, discussion
boards, forums exist which can be leveraged based on the message and the
type of community being targeted. Of importance is to remember to think
about the cost/benefits of the platform chosen.

Cross posting could also be an option; this occurs when an author shares
the same post or content on multiple social media platforms or online
forums. Typically, they would publish the same message, image, video, or
link on different platforms simultaneously. This allows the user to
reach a wider audience and ensure that their content is visible to all
of their followers or community members, regardless of which platform
they prefer to use. Cross-posting can increase the visibility and
engagement of their content and maintain a consistent online presence
across various platforms. However, it is essential to be mindful of the
context and audience on each platform to ensure that the content remains
relevant and tailored to the specific platform\'s users.

We have kept in line with this by posting across the 3 platforms we have
highlighted (Medium, Github, StackOverflow).

## **Conclusion**

The aim of being able to write non-technically as a techie is to
effectively communicate complex technical concepts and ideas to a
broader audience. While technical expertise is essential in the field of
technology, the ability to convey information in a clear, concise, and
understandable manner to non-technical individuals is equally crucial.
By honing their non-technical writing skills, techies can bridge the gap
between technical jargon and everyday language, making their work more
accessible and relevant to a wider range of stakeholders. This skill
empowers techies to share their knowledge, ideas, and innovations with
the public, decision-makers, and colleagues from different domains,
fostering better collaboration and understanding across diverse fields.
Ultimately, the aim is to democratize information, promote inclusivity,
and enhance the impact of technology by making it more relatable and
beneficial to all.
